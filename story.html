    <h1>My Journey through Making Pasta</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Early Pasta Memories</h2>
    <p>Ever since I was a kid, I've always loved pasta—whether it's basic spaghetti, angel hair, ravioli, or rotini.<br>Much of my experience with pasta has come from buying boxes of dried pasta and, later, finding fresh pasta in stores or ordering it in restaurants. My relationship with pasta changed during the COVID pandemic.</p>

    <h2>A Pandemic Shift</h2>
    <p>Working from home during and after COVID inspired me to cook more food—not just to cook, but to mimic dishes served in restaurants.</p>

    <h2>First Projects &amp; New Gear</h2>
    <p>My first project was baking <strong>sourdough bread</strong> with a starter I'd made myself. That led me to grow my own sprouts, make my own sauces, and even brew beverages like <strong>ginger beer</strong> from a ginger starter. As I shopped for groceries, I shifted away from ready‑made items and focused on natural products such as meats, vegetables, and grains.</p>
    <p>During COVID I also started buying more kitchen tools. One purchase was a <strong>KitchenAid mixer</strong>, which has been invaluable for creating sourdough bread. One appealing feature of the KitchenAid is its attachment system. The attachment that interested me most was the <em>five‑piece Pasta Deluxe Set</em>, which included a pasta roller with adjustable thickness settings and four pasta cutters of varying widths.</p>

    <h2>The Big Purchase</h2>
    <p>It was <strong>February&nbsp;5<sup>th</sup>,&nbsp;2023</strong> when I decided to buy this set. I was very excited to make my own pasta, yet I didn't know what was required.</p>

    <h2>First Attempts at Pasta Dough</h2>
    <p>I began by searching online for instructions on making pasta dough and—staying true to my goal of using fresh ingredients—chose to use only <strong>flour and eggs</strong>. Many recipes called for <strong>100&nbsp;g of flour for every large egg</strong>. As someone who prefers metric measurements, this sounded straightforward. Using my KitchenAid mixer, I tried making the dough rather than mixing by hand, but when it came time to flatten it for the roller and cutters I found the dough was very sticky compared with descriptions of ideal pasta dough. Drawing on my research background, I set out to ensure the dough wasn't too sticky or too dry.</p>

    <h2>Chasing the Perfect Ratio</h2>
    <p>Using the internet, I searched for information on pasta‑dough ratios. From my sourdough experience I knew about <strong>hydration</strong>: for example, 100&nbsp;g of flour with 50&nbsp;g of water is 50<sup>%</sup> hydration, while 100&nbsp;g of flour with 80&nbsp;g of water is 80<sup>%</sup> hydration. I figured there must be a similar calculation for pasta dough.</p>
    <blockquote>
      In one discussion someone suggested weighing the egg yolks in grams and then multiplying by 1.61 to determine the amount of flour needed.
    </blockquote>
    <p>After much experimentation I simplified that to <strong>1.6 × (yolk weight)</strong>. Ever since then I've been able to produce dough that rolls and cuts consistently—thanks, in part, to the KitchenAid.</p>
