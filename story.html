  <h1>My Journey into Making Pasta</h1>
  <hr>

  <h2>Early Pasta Memories</h2>
  <p>I've enjoyed pasta since I was a child, whether it's simple spaghetti, angel hair, ravioli, or rotini.<br>Much of my pasta experience has come from buying boxes of dry pasta and then buying fresh pasta at the grocery or in restaurants.</p>

  <h2>A Pandemic Shift</h2>
  <p>My pasta experience changed during the COVID‑19 pandemic. Working from home inspired me to cook more—and to discover that restaurant‑style dishes are possible in a home kitchen.</p>

  <h2>Baking, Fermenting, and Gearing Up</h2>
  <p>My first venture was baking sourdough bread with a starter I made myself. That led me to sprout beans, blend sauces, and brew ginger beer. I began buying fewer ready‑made items and more natural ingredients such as meats, vegetables, and grains.</p>
  <p>COVID also nudged me to upgrade my equipment. I bought a KitchenAid mixer for kneading dough. Its attachments were a bonus; the five‑piece Pasta Deluxe Set—with a roller and four cutters—was the one that really intrigued me.</p>

  <h2>The Big Purchase</h2>
  <p>On February 5<sup>th</sup>, 2023 I finally bought the set. I was eager to make my own pasta but had no idea what the process entailed.</p>

  <h2>First Attempts at Pasta Dough</h2>
  <p>I researched pasta dough recipes online and stuck to my goal of using fresh ingredients. Many call for <strong>100 g of flour per large egg</strong>. That seemed simple enough, but when I mixed the dough in my KitchenAid it turned out far stickier than the guides suggested.</p>

  <h2>Chasing the Perfect Ratio</h2>
  <p>With a research mindset, I looked for a more precise formula. In bread baking we discuss <strong>hydration</strong>: 100 g of flour with 50 g of water is 50<sup>%</sup> hydration. I guessed there must be a similar ratio for pasta.</p>
  <blockquote>
    Deep in a forum thread I found a claim that weighing the egg yolks and multiplying by 1.61 would give the right amount of flour.
  </blockquote>
  <p>After plenty of testing I rounded to <strong>1.6 × (yolk weight)</strong>. Since adopting that ratio my dough rolls and cuts beautifully—even without the mixer.</p>
