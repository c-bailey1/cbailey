  <h1>My Journey through Making Pasta</h1>
  <hr>

  <p>Ever since I was a kid, I've always loved pasta, whether it's basic spaghetti, angel hair, ravioli, or gnocchi.<br>Much of my experience with pasta has come from buying boxes of dried pasta and, later on, discovering low-quality pasta from the store or dining at restaurants. My experience with pasta changed with the COVID pandemic.</p>

  <p>Being able to work from home during COVID and after COVID, I have made a decision to start cooking more food. Not just being able to cook but being able to mimic food that is cooked in restaurants. My first project was to start baking <strong>sourdough bread</strong>, for which I created a starter. This hobby has led me to grow my sprouts, make my own sauces, and even create my own beverages, such as <strong>ginger beer</strong> made from a ginger starter. As I buy items from the grocery store, I've moved in a direction from buying ready-made items to focusing on natural products like meats, vegetables, and grains, for example. During COVID, I also started to buy more cooking items. One purchase that I made was a <strong>KitchenAid mixer</strong>, which has been very useful in creating my sourdough bread. I was also interested in the KitchenAid mixer because of the ability to add attachments. One attachment that interests me was the five-piece pasta deluxe set. The set included a pasta roller, which had settings for different thicknesses, and four pasta cutting sets, which ranged in thickness.</p>

  <p>It was <strong>February&nbsp;5<sup>th</sup>,&nbsp;2023</strong>, that I decided to buy this set. I was very excited to make my own pasta, yet I didn't know what was necessary to do it. I began by researching how to make pasta dough online, following the instructions with the intention of using fresh ingredients. I chose the option of using <strong>flour and egg only</strong>. So many recipes online call for <strong>100&nbsp;grams of flour for every one large egg</strong>. Being a person who likes to use the metric system regarding cooking, my choice seemed pretty easy. Using my KitchenAid mixer, I try to make the dough versus doing it by hand. But when it was time to roll and cut the dough, I found it was stickier than the pasta dough descriptions. Experienced in research, I decided to find a way to ensure the dough was neither too sticky nor too dry.</p>

  <p>Using the Internet, I looked up information about how to make dough for pasta and see if there is a weight ratio that I can use to make the best pasta dough. Based on my sourdough baking experience, I found numerous online articles discussing the flour-to-water ratio, also known as <strong>hydration</strong>. So 100 grams of flour and 50 grams of water, for example, would be considered 50<sup>%</sup> hydration, while 100 grams of flour and 80 grams of water would be considered 80<sup>%</sup> hydration. I deduced that a precise calculation must exist to create the ideal pasta dough.</p>

  <blockquote>My search led me to a discussion in which someone stated that you should weigh the egg yolk in grams and then multiply that weight by 1.61 to determine the amount of flour needed.</blockquote>

  <p>After much experience trying this process, I decided to use <strong>1.6</strong> as the value. Since then, I have consistently made it easier to roll and cut. Bye-bye, KitchenAid.</p>
