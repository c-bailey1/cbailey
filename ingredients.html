	<h2>How to Make the Dough for Pasta</h2>
	<p>To make pasta dough, you’ll need just a <strong>few simple ingredients</strong>. Each ingredient plays a crucial role in developing the flavor and texture of the pasta once cooked. It’s important to use the freshest ingredients available and to measure them accurately for optimal results. Here’s what you’ll need:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Flour</li>
		<li>Egg</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>That’s it!</strong> With just flour and eggs, you have everything you need to make homemade pasta from scratch. This simple, time-tested combination comes together to form a smooth, workable dough with a bit of mixing and kneading.

	<h2>Flour</h2>
	<p>Flour is the backbone of pasta dough, and choosing the right type can significantly impact the texture and workability of your pasta. Here are some options:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    <strong>All-Purpose Flour</strong>
	    <br> 	
	    <img src="blog.jpg" alt="Paragraph Image" width="15%">
	    <p>A versatile and easily accessible choice, all-purpose flour works well for homemade pasta when 00 flour or semolina are unavailable, producing a relatively soft dough and smooth texture.
		</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <strong>Semolina Flour</strong>
	    <br> 	
	    <img src="blog.jpg" alt="Paragraph Image" width="15%">
	    <p>This coarse flour, made from durum wheat, has a slightly gritty texture and provides pasta with a firm bite and a golden color.
		</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <strong>Durum Wheat Flour</strong>
	    <br> 	
	    <img src="blog.jpg" alt="Paragraph Image" width="15%">
	    <p>Finely milled from tough durum wheat, this flour is less coarse than semolina. With a high protein content, it is ideal for making sturdy pasta with a chewy texture.
		</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <strong>Spelt Flour</strong>
	    <br> 	
	    <img src="blog.jpg" alt="Paragraph Image" width="15%">
	    <p>People often combine spelt flour, an ancient grain flour with a mild, slightly sweet flavor, with other flours to create a more rustic, whole-grain pasta.
		</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <strong>Whole Wheat Flour</strong>
	    <br> 	
	    <img src="blog.jpg" alt="Paragraph Image" width="15%">
	    <p>Hearty and nutritious, whole wheat flour adds a nutty flavor and dense texture. Combine it best with 00 flour or all-purpose flour to maintain the dough's pliability.
		</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <strong>00 Flour</strong>
	    <br> 	
	    <img src="blog.jpg" alt="Paragraph Image" width="15%">
	    <p>This ultra-fine Italian flour has a soft texture and produces silky, elastic dough that is easy to roll, making it perfect for delicate pasta varieties like tagliatelle, fettuccine, and ravioli.
		</p>
	  </li>
	</ol>

	<p>Flour is the <strong>backbone of pasta dough,</strong> and selecting the right type can significantly affect the texture and workability of your pasta. While it's possible to make pasta with the various flours mentioned, I prefer using <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/what-is-00-flour-pizza-pasta-108281" target="_blank">00 flour</a>. This flour is finely milled and silky soft, resulting in a smooth, elastic dough that’s ideal for rolling and shaping.
	</p>
	<p>Each flour type contributes its own unique character to the pasta. Semolina imparts a delightful bite, whole wheat adds a nutty flavor, while all-purpose flour serves as a wonderful starting point if that's what you have available.
