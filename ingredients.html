	<h2>Flour</h2>
	<p>Flour is the backbone of pasta dough, and choosing the right type can significantly impact the texture and workability of your pasta. Here are some options:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    <strong>All-Purpose Flour</strong>
	    <p>A versatile and easily accessible choice, all-purpose flour works well for homemade pasta when 00 flour or semolina are unavailable, producing a relatively soft dough and smooth texture.
		</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <strong>Semolina Flour</strong>
	    <p>This coarse flour, made from durum wheat, has a slightly gritty texture and provides pasta with a firm bite and a golden color.
		</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <strong>Durum Wheat Flour</strong>
	    <p>Finely milled from tough durum wheat, this flour is less coarse than semolina. With a high protein content, it is ideal for making sturdy pasta with a chewy texture.
		</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <strong>Spelt Flour</strong>
	    <p>People often combine spelt flour, an ancient grain flour with a mild, slightly sweet flavor, with other flours to create a more rustic, whole-grain pasta.
		</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <strong>Whole Wheat Flour</strong>
	    <p>Hearty and nutritious, whole wheat flour adds a nutty flavor and dense texture. Combine it best with 00 flour or all-purpose flour to maintain the dough's pliability.
		</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <strong>00 Flour</strong>
	    <p>This ultra-fine Italian flour has a soft texture and produces silky, elastic dough that is easy to roll, making it perfect for delicate pasta varieties like tagliatelle, fettuccine, and ravioli.
		</p>
	  </li>
	</ol>
	<p>Flour is the <strong>backbone of pasta dough,</strong> and selecting the right type can significantly affect the texture and workability of your pasta. While it's possible to make pasta with the various flours mentioned, I prefer using <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/what-is-00-flour-pizza-pasta-108281" target="_blank">00 flour</a>. This flour is finely milled and silky soft, resulting in a smooth, elastic dough that’s ideal for rolling and shaping.
	</p>
	<p>Each flour type contributes its own unique character to the pasta. Semolina imparts a delightful bite, whole wheat adds a nutty flavor, while all-purpose flour serves as a wonderful starting point if that's what you have available.
