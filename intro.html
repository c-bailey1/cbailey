    <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of Buffalo. During my time there, I worked at the Social Development Laboratory, which studies developmental psychopathology. Research lab examines the forms (relational and physical) and functions (proactive and reactive) of aggressive behavior. During my time there I was able to publish a research paper examining aggressive behavioral subtypes among college students. </p>
        <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I've worked for two departments at Yale University. First was at the Yale Child Study Center, where I managed laboratory technologies for developmental and clinical neuroscience research. Next, I worked for the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence on a research project with Lockheed Martin and the United States Air Force to investigate human-computer interaction and how computers can aid in emotion regulation.</p>
            <p>My current position is Assistant Director of Yale Young Global Scholars, which is a summer academic program for high school students. My primary responsibility is to manage the admissions cycle while also identifying new technology that will enhance the program.</p>
