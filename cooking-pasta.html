		Cooking fresh pasta is <strong>quick and simple,</strong> but precise timing and technique are essential. Here are the basic steps:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Fresh pasta requires space to move, so use more water than you would for dried pasta. Add a suitable amount of salt, approximately 1–2 tablespoons per gallon of water.
		</li>
		<li>
			Gently add your fresh pasta to the boiling water, stirring immediately to prevent sticking. Fresh pasta cooks much faster than dried, so stay close; it usually takes just 2 to 4 minutes, depending on the thickness and shape.
		</li>
		<li>
			Taste a strand early. It should be tender but still hold its shape, offering a firm bite without being doughy. Don’t wait too long, as fresh pasta can overcook quickly.
		</li>
		<li>
			Once cooked, drain the pasta, but avoid rinsing it. If you are preparing your sauce, transfer the pasta directly into it while it’s still cooking. The starchy water helps the sauce adhere better.
		</li>
		<li>
			Toss the pasta gently in your sauce over medium heat for a minute or two. This allows the flavors to meld and results in a perfectly coated dish.
		</li>
