	<p>When it comes to making pasta dough, mixing flour and eggs can be a rewarding process that results in a homemade, high-quality dish. <strong>Here are two methods for combining the ingredients:</strong>
	</p>
	<h2>Mixing by Hand</h2>
	<p>To mix the ingredients:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Start by creating a mound of flour on a clean work surface.

		</li>
		<li>Next, make a well in the center to hold the eggs. Adding a splash of olive oil or a pinch of salt is optional.
		<br>

		</li>
		<li>Gently whisk the eggs with a fork, gradually incorporating flour from the sides.
		<br>

		</li>
		<li>Once the mixture thickens, knead it by hand for about 8–10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
		<br>

		</li>
		<li>Finally, wrap the dough in plastic and let it rest for at least 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.

		</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Using a Mixer</h2>
	<p>Using a stand mixer, such as a <a href="https://youtu.be/qh3uSaVGU68?si=KKsjF2sgm6ttorkR" target="_blank">KitchenAid</a>, simplifies the dough-making process and reduces physical effort. In this method, add the dry ingredients to the bowl with a dough hook attachment, followed by the eggs and any optional ingredients.

	</p>
	<p>The mixer will combine and knead the dough, typically taking 5–7 minutes on a low setting. It's important not to overwork the dough; once it starts to pull away from the sides and forms a ball, it’s ready.
		<br>

	</p>
	<p>
		A quick hand-knead for a minute or two can help finish it off before wrapping it up to rest.

	<hr />
	<p>Whether you choose to make dough by hand or with a machine, the <strong>resting period is crucial.</strong> It allows moisture to distribute evenly and the gluten network to relax, making the dough easier to roll out later.
	</p>
	<p>
		After resting, the dough should feel smooth, supple, and slightly tacky. At that point, you can shape it into a sheet and cut it.
