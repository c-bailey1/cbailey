	<h2>History of Pasta</h2>
	<img src="blog.jpg" alt="Paragraph Image" width="25%">	
	<p>While many believe that Marco Polo brought pasta to Italy following his journey to the Far East in the 13th century, the origins of pasta may actually date back much earlier, to the 4th century B.C. Evidence of pasta-making may have been discovered in the form of a relic found in an Etruscan tomb that is believed to depict pasta-making equipment including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Pastry Board</li>
		<li>Roling Pin</li>
		<li>Cutting Wheel</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Although some historians suggest that the tools depicted in the tomb may have produced testaroli, an ancient flatbread/pasta hybrid, these tools are very similar to those still used in Italy today for making handmade pasta.</p>
	<hr />
	<p>Since the 13th century, mentions of pasta dishes, such as macaroni, ravioli, gnocchi, and vermicelli, have increasingly appeared throughout the Italian Peninsula. In 1787, Goethe noted in his diary, <em>Travel to Italy</em>, the presence of maccheroni vendors selling pasta from their street stalls in Naples. Today, pasta has become a fundamental element of Italian cuisine and culture, showcasing a diverse array of shapes, sizes, and regional variations.</p>
